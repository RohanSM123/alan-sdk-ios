Add a voice assistant to your application. With no or minimal changes to the existing UI.

## How to start

To bring voice control to an iOS application:

1. [Sign up for Alan Studio](https://studio.alan.app/register) to build and test voice scripts in JavaScript.
2. Use the Alan iOS SDK to embed the Alan button to your application or page. For details, see [Alan AI documentation]( https://alan.app/docs/client-api/ios/ios-api).

## Downloads

## Example apps

In the [Examples](https://github.com/alan-ai/alan-sdk-ios/tree/master/examples) folder, you can find example apps integrated with the Alan voice SDK for iOS. Launch the app, tap the Alan button and start giving voice commands. For example, in the Food Delivery app you can ask: "What is it?" or "What do you have?"
